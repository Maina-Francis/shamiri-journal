# Shamiri Journal App

A modern journaling application with mood tracking, AI analysis, and personal insights.

## Live Demo

**Try the app here with full AI capabilities:** [https://shamiri-journal-frontend.onrender.com/](https://shamiri-journal-frontend.onrender.com)

> **Note:** The application is deployed on Render's free tier, which puts services to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. The first load may take 1-2 minutes while the server spins up. Subsequent interactions will be much faster.

## Overview

Shamiri Journal is a full-stack web application designed to help users track their thoughts, feelings, and daily experiences through journaling. The app leverages AI to provide personalized insights, mood analysis, and topic tracking to help users gain a deeper understanding of their emotional patterns and well-being.

## API Documentation

The API is fully documented using Swagger/OpenAPI specification. You can access the interactive API documentation in two ways:

### Swagger UI Documentation
When running the backend server locally, visit:
```
http://localhost:5000/api-docs
```

This provides an interactive interface where you can:
